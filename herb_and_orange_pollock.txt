Herb and Orange Pollock

Ingredients:

Olive Oil

2 lbs Pollock Fillets – Thawed

About 2 Tablespoons Old Bay Seasoning (less sodium version)

About 2 Tablespoons Herbes de Provence

1 Large Orange

Directions:

Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Line a baking sheet with foil and spray with olive oil. Be sure to use a pan or sheet that has edges, as this fish tends to release quite a bit of water during cooking.
Lay the fillets out on the baking sheet in a single layer and spray lightly with olive oil.

Sprinkle the fish with Old bay and Herbes de Provence.

Slice the orange into 1/4 inch rounds and lay them on top of the seasoned fillets. If you have long fillets (I had a mix) make a slit in the orange rounds from the center to one edge, twist and stretch them across the fish.
Cover with foil and rest about 5 minutes.

Bake 5 minutes covered, carefully remove the foil top (there will be a lot of juices in the pan), and bake 10 minutes uncovered. I broiled mine for 3 minutes afterward to get a little bit of a crisp on top, but you don’t have to.

Serve over baby greens and enjoy!
