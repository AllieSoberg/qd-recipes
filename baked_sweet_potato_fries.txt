Baked Sweet Potato Fries

ingredients

2 or 3 good-sized sweet potatoes (you’ll want a single layer when they’re all cut)

3-4 Tablespoons Olive Oil

1 teaspoon Herbes de Provence

1/2 teaspoon garlic powder

1/2 teaspoon Salt (or to taste) – I use

Himalayan pink salt in a grinder

1/2 teaspoon Pepper – Freshly ground

1 teaspoon Tony Chachere’s Creole Seasoning (optional)

Preheat your oven to 425 degrees (Fahrenheit). Cut a sheet of foil a little larger than your baking sheet and gently crumple it, then use it to coat the baking sheet. Pre-wrinkling your foil will help keep the fries from sticking. I usually spray the coated pan with oil as well.
Wash the sweet potatoes, remove any wayward roots or eyes, and peel if desired. Then slice into 1/2 inch wide strips, you don’t want to go too much thicker than that, but you can go thinner if you like them crispier or need them to cook even faster.
In a gallon sized freezer bag or a large bowl, add the sliced potatoes and the rest of the ingredients, seal and toss until the potatoes are well coated, if they aren’t a bit shiny add a little more oil and re-toss.
Spread the seasoned fries in a single layer on your prepared baking sheet. Place on an upper rack and bake for 20 minutes until fork tender.
If they aren’t as crisp as you’d like them to be at this point, just switch on the broiler for 3 to 5 minutes but keep a close eye on them so they don’t burn!
Serve immediately – as if you could help it. Or cool and store in a refrigerated airtight container for up to 4 days.


Sunday prep? Eh. Not really.
These are so quick and easy they aren’t really worth prepping ahead. But you can make them ahead though and enjoy them for the week!

Reheat by putting them in the toaster oven on toast or broil for 5-10 minutes, or re-bake at 350 for 10-15 minutes until heated through.
